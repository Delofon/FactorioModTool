# Factorio Mod Tool
 I hate it when you have to restart Factorio with 300+ mods enabled/downloaded and it takes 1337 minutes to complete and when you also have to restart like each second.
 
 This tool should add a process of downloading, uninstalling, enabling and disabling mods outside of Factorio.
 
 This tool comes in two flavours:
 1. A CLI tool, factoriomodtool itself.
 2. A GUI wrapper for the factoriomodtool.
